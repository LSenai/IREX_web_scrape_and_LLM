# IREX web scraping and project categorization
* To speed up my on-boarding and take inventory of IREX’s projects as they relate to technology, I developed a script to scrape IREX’s website to gather information on over 90 projects utilizing Beautiful Soup Python Library.
* Utilized an instruction-tuned LLM (Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1) with function calling to determine if each project had a signiﬁcant digital component, and if so, provide a summary and key statistics into a spreadsheet format.

This is an illustrative version mean to demonstrate some of the following skills:
* scripting ability using HuggingFace APIs
* familiarity with prompt engineering
* web-scraping 

A better version will use better prompts and post-processing to populate the spreadsheet. 

*Note*: you will need your own API key to run this on your own.
